# Windows Subsystem for Android unofficial installer
This script is a batch script that installs Windows Subsystem for Android that runs on Windows 11 devices.

# TODO
 - Turn Windows Features On or Off in batch script
 - curl: https://store.rg-adguard.net/api/GetFiles (POST?) and get MSIX URL. Currently guiding users who uses this script to copy the link from https://store.rg-adguard.net/.
   - Using a mirror could work on this case?
   
# How this works - a teardown
```batch
aria2c -x 16 -s 16 -o wsa_installation.msix "%url%"
```
This uses `aria2c` to download the WSA URL the user provided in 16 connections, which accerlates the download. The URL provided by the user is stored on a variable.
Want to change to your preferred downloader? Then change the command to `curl -o wsa_installation.msix "%url%"` or `wget -O wsa_installation.msix "%url%"`. Use your own command? then make sure the URL part is set to `%url%` and that's all.
```powershell
powershell Add-AppxPackage -Path wsa_installation.msix
```
This uses `PowerShell` to add (install) the downloaded package to the computer.

## Requires Admin Elevation
